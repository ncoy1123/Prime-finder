# Prime-finder
These are basic programs for finding all the prime numbers inbewtween ranges. One is single core and the other is multithreaded. Set the bottem range where you left off if you want to continue where you left off. To export the numbers to a text file put >name_of_file.txt at the end when its ran. The quad thread one is messed up starting at 1k because of the loops. If someone knows how to solve that it world be great!
