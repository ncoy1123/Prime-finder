# Prime-finder
These are basic programs for finding all the prime numbers inbewtween ranges. One is single core and the other is multithreaded. Set the bottem range where you left off if you want to continue where you left off. There is a number duplication glitch where it sfine at the beginning its fine but after its first 1k cycle the cores start of overlap. If someone knows how to solve that it world be great!
